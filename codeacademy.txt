$ git checkout HEAD filename
  Discards changes in the working directory.

$ git reset HEAD filename
  Unstages file changes in the staging area.

$ git reset commit_SHA
  Resets to a previous commit in your commit history.

While working on a file, you find a small bug in a separate file from a previous commit that needs to be fixed before you continue.

$ git stash
Running the command above will store your work temporarily for later use in a hidden directory.

At this point, you can switch branches and do work elsewhere.

Once the bug is fixed, you want to retrieve the code you were working on previously, you can “pop” the work that was stored when you used git stash.

$ git stash pop
From here, you can continue your work and commit it when ready.
